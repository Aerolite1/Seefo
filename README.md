# Worse SeedInfo tool

# This was just a mini-project I did while procrastinating, don't expect it to be good.

A (badly made) python version of SeedTypeInfo by panda4994 with some elements/tools from Cubiomes by Cubitect

# Features:

Can make large lists of possible strings for an integer seed

Can save all 2^16 sister integer seeds to an output file

Can translate str to int and int to str

Can take a string input and create more strings that result in the same seed

Can copy all sister seeds from a string and save it as a file

# Instructions:
1. Download either the py OR exe
2. Run the file
3. Follow the steps
4. Pray that I didnt mess up my code :c

# Note: duplicate the output folder if you want to save the data, as it will be overwritten the next time you run the code.
