# A worse SeedInfo tool
# A (badly made) python version of SeedTypeInfo by panda4994 with some elements/tools from Cubiomes by Cubitect
# Can make large lists of posible strings for an integer seed
# Can save all 2^16 sister seeds to an output file
Instructions:
1. Download either the py OR exe
2. Run the file
3. Follow the steps
4. Pray that I didnt mess up my code :c

Note: duplicate the output folder if you want to save the data, as it will be overwritten the next time you run the code.
